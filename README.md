# Probabilistic Safety Verification: A Situation Coverage Grid Approach

As autonomous vehicles are increasingly deployed in safety-critical environments, ensuring their safe operation under diverse conditions is paramount. This paper presents a novel approach for their safety verification based on systematic situation extraction, probabilistic modelling and verification. We build upon the concept of a situation coverage grid, which exhaustively enumerates environmental configurations relevant to the vehicle's operation. This grid is augmented with quantitative probabilistic data collected from situation-based system testing, capturing probabilistic transitions between situations. We then generate a probabilistic model that encodes the dynamics of both normal and unsafe system behavior. Safety properties extracted from hazard analysis and formalised in temporal logic are verified through probabilistic model checking against this model. Results demonstrate that our approach not only identifies high-risk situation but also enables ranking of situations by criticality levels essential. Our approach provides quantitative safety guarantees and supports compliance with regulatory standards, paving the way for robust deployment of autonomous systems in real-world domains.
