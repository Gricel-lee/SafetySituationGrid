# Probabilistic Safety Verification: A Situation Coverage Grid Approach

## Description:
Safety verification of autonomous vehicles based on systematic situation extraction, probabilistic modelling and verification. Build upon the concept of a situation coverage grid, which exhaustively enumerates environmental configurations relevant to the vehicle's operation, an augmented one with quantitative probabilistic data collected is build. A probabilistic model is then automatically generated and verified under safety properties extracted from hazard analysis and formalised in temporal logic. This approach provides quantitative safety guarantees and supports compliance with regulatory standards.
